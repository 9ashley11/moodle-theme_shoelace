<h1>
<a id="reporting-issues" class="anchor" href="#reporting-issues" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Reporting Issues</h1>

<p>Before reporting an issue, please ensure that you are running the latest version for your release of Moodle.  It is essential
that you are operating the required version of Moodle as stated at the top - this is because the theme relies on core
functionality that is out of its control.</p>

<p>I operate a policy that I will fix all genuine issues for free.  Improvements are at my discretion.  I am happy to make bespoke
customisations / improvements for a negotiated fee. </p>

<p>When reporting an issue you can post in the theme's forum on Moodle.org (currently 'moodle.org/mod/forum/view.php?id=46')
or contact me direct (details at the bottom).</p>

<p>It is essential that you provide as much information as possible, the critical information being the contents of the format's 
version.php file.  Other version information such as specific Moodle version, theme name and version also helps.  A screen shot
can be really useful in visualising the issue along with any files you consider to be relevant.</p>
