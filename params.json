If you would like support from\r\nme then I'm happy to provide it for a fee (please see my contact details above).  Otherwise, the 'Themes' forum:\r\nmoodle.org/mod/forum/view.php?id=46 is an excellent place to ask questions.\r\n\r\nSponsorships\r\n============\r\nThis theme is provided to you for free, and if you want to express your gratitude for using this theme, please consider sponsoring\r\nby:\r\n\r\nPayPal - Please contact me via my 'Moodle profile' (above) for details as I am an individual and therefore am unable to have\r\n'buy me now' buttons under their terms.\r\n\r\nFlattr - https://flattr.com/profile/gjb2048\r\n\r\nSponsorships may allow me to provide you with more or better features in less time.\r\n\r\nCustomisation\r\n=============\r\nIf you like this theme and would like me to customise it, transpose functionality to another theme or build a new theme\r\nfrom scratch, then I offer competitive rates.  Please contact me via www.gjbarnard.co.uk/contact/ or gjbarnard at gmail dot com\r\nto discuss your requirements.\r\n\r\nRequired version of Moodle\r\n==========================\r\nThis version works with Moodle version 2015111600.00 3.0 (Build: 20151116) and above within the 3.0 branch until the\r\nnext release.\r\n\r\nPlease ensure that your hardware and software complies with 'Requirements' in 'Installing Moodle' on\r\n'docs.moodle.org/30/en/Installing_Moodle'.\r\n\r\nInstallation\r\n============\r\n 1. Ensure you have the version of Moodle as stated above in 'Required version of Moodle'.  This is essential as the\r\n    theme relies on underlying core code that is out of my control.\r\n 2. Login as an administrator and put Moodle in 'Maintenance Mode' so that there are no users using it bar you as the administrator.\r\n 3. Copy the extracted 'shoelace' folder to the '/theme/' folder.\r\n 4. Go to 'Site administration' -> 'Notifications' and follow standard the 'plugin' update notification.\r\n 5. Select as the theme for the site.\r\n 6. Put Moodle out of Maintenance Mode.\r\n\r\nUpgrading\r\n=========\r\n 1. Ensure you have the version of Moodle as stated above in 'Required version of Moodle'.  This is essential as the\r\n    theme relies on underlying core code that is out of my control.\r\n 2. Login as an administrator and put Moodle in 'Maintenance Mode' so that there are no users using it bar you as the administrator.\r\n 3. Make a backup of your old 'shoelace' folder in '/theme/' and then delete the folder.\r\n 4. Copy the replacement extracted 'shoelace' folder to the '/theme/' folder.\r\n 5. Go to 'Site administration' -> 'Notifications' and follow standard the 'plugin' update notification.\r\n 6. If automatic 'Purge all caches' appears not to work by lack of display etc. then perform a manual 'Purge all caches'\r\n   under 'Home -> Site administration -> Development -> Purge all caches'.\r\n 7. Put Moodle out of Maintenance Mode.\r\n\r\nUninstallation\r\n==============\r\n 1. Put Moodle in 'Maintenance Mode' so that there are no users using it bar you as the administrator.\r\n 2. Change the theme to another theme of your choice.\r\n 3. In '/theme/' remove the folder 'shoelace'.\r\n 4. Put Moodle out of Maintenance Mode.\r\n\r\nReporting Issues\r\n================\r\nBefore reporting an issue, please ensure that you are running the latest version for your release of Moodle.  It is essential\r\nthat you are operating the required version of Moodle as stated at the top - this is because the theme relies on core\r\nfunctionality that is out of its control.\r\n\r\nI operate a policy that I will fix all genuine issues for free.  Improvements are at my discretion.  I am happy to make bespoke\r\ncustomisations / improvements for a negotiated fee. \r\n\r\nWhen reporting an issue you can post in the theme's forum on Moodle.org (currently 'moodle.org/mod/forum/view.php?id=46')\r\nor contact me direct (details at the bottom).\r\n\r\nIt is essential that you provide as much information as possible, the critical information being the contents of the format's \r\nversion.php file.  Other version information such as specific Moodle version, theme name and version also helps.  A screen shot\r\ncan be really useful in visualising the issue along with any files you consider to be relevant.\r\n\r\nVersion Information\r\n===================\r\nSee Changes.md\r\n\r\nThanks\r\n======\r\nMy thanks go to all the creators and participants of the Bootstrap theme:\r\nBas Brands, David Scotson, Stuart Lamour, Mark Aberdour, Paul Hibbitts and Mary Evans.\r\n\r\nAnd again to Mary Evans for the 'Clean' theme.\r\n\r\nMe\r\n==\r\nG J Barnard MSc.
